Project Title: Online Voting Management System (Web3 dApp)
Project Description:
The Online Voting Management System is a decentralized web application (Web3 dApp) that enables users to securely vote online using blockchain technology. The system ensures transparency, immutability, and fairness by recording votes on a blockchain network.

Before voting, users must record a video for identity verification, ensuring that only legitimate users cast votes. This enhances security and prevents unauthorized voting. The video is securely stored and linked to the voter's identity, adding an extra layer of verification.

Developed using Solidity, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this system eliminates the risks of vote tampering and central authority control. The platform allows an admin (owner) to add candidates, and registered users can cast a single vote during the active voting period. Smart contracts manage the entire voting process, preventing multiple votes from the same user.

Key Features:
âœ… Decentralized & Secure â€“ Votes are recorded on a blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing manipulation.
âœ… Smart Contract-Based Voting â€“ The voting process is automated using Solidity smart contracts.
âœ… Immutable Records â€“ Every vote is permanently stored on the blockchain, preventing any alterations.
âœ… Voting Time Control â€“ Voting is only allowed within a predefined period, managed by the smart contract.
âœ… Single Vote Per User â€“ A mapping mechanism ensures that each user can vote only once.
âœ… Real-Time Vote Counting â€“ Users can check the vote count at any time.
âœ… Video Recording Before Voting â€“ Ensures voter identity verification and prevents fake votes.






This project demonstrates how blockchain combined with video verification can revolutionize e-voting systems by ensuring security, decentralization, and public trust. ðŸš€
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
